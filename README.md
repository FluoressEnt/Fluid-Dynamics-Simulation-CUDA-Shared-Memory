[Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games paper by Jos Stam](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/847f/819a4ea14bd789aca8bc88e85e906cfc657c.pdf)

### Getting Started:
Install CUDA 10.0. 
Copy *freeglut.lib* and *freeglut.dll* from the dependencies folder into the folder found at Fluid-Dynamics-Simulation-CUDA-Shared-Memory/Fluid Dynamics Sim CUDA v2.0/

The provided libraries use x64. Run in Release mode for best results.
